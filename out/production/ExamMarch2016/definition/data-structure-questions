Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
we need data structure for easy implementation of the operation like inserting, deleteing,editing.
sometime we have to deal with million of data. for better memory allocation and less compile time we need
data structure.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array size is static, we cant change the size. Arraylist is dynamic, it will change the size of array automatically when needed.

what is LinkedList?
linkedList is also arraylist which has two field. one carries data and another carries the reference or address to the next node.

what is queue?
Queue is a data structure that follows the first in first out policy.

what is stack?
stack is a data structure that follows the last in first out policy.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
first in first out: it ll retrive the firts inserted data from the queue.
last in first out: it ll retrive the last inserted data first from the stack.

what is the order of complexity?
order of complexity used to find out which algorithm is faster to compute.generally the smaller the order of
complexity, faster it will run.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
best case when the number of searching operation is minimum.that means the searching element is in the first location
of an array. so the tim complexity will be O(1).

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
worst case would be when the number of searching operation is maximum.that means the searching element is in the first location
of an array. so the tim complexity will be O(n).

what is tree in data structure?

what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
